# SP1026 solution
### 1.the meaning of this problem
In this problem, we need to calculate the expections times we need to make every sides being throw
### 2.the solution
If we have meet i sides, the expection for the next n-i sides is f[i],so the next step we have two possible, one is there is no new side,its possibility is $\frac{i}{n}$ another is a new side,its possibility is $\frac{n-i}{n}$
For this solution, we can infer a function
$f[i] = f[i+1]*\frac{n-i}{n} + \frac{i}{n} + 1$
### 3.the code
we can simplify the function above
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#define N 1010
using namespace std;
double a[N];
int main() {
    int n;
    double ans = 0;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 1;i <= n;i++) {
        ans += double(n)/double(i);
    }
    printf("%lf",ans);
}
```
